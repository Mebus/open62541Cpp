This is an example of an OPC server framework that combines Open62541 with Wt (3.3.6) and DesignerWt.

The example shows how to use node contexts to map variable nodes to application variables and how to integrate a web based GUI.

In this example the web GUI uses a common data store with the OPC server. The data generation is by an OPC timed event, though one could use a threaded process instead.
